Spam calls and deepfake technologies are increasingly being exploited by fraudsters in financial scams. Spam calls are
often used for phishing, impersonation, and social engineering, while deepfake technology is employed to bypass Video
Know Your Customer (VKYC) processes by mimicking legitimate users. These attacks not only lead to significant financial
losses but also erode trust in digital and voice-based communication systems.


A Financial Fraud Detector leverages AI and mobile technologies to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in real
time, similar to the tactics seen in scams like those in Jamtara, where fraudsters impersonate bank representatives or
trick users into revealing sensitive information. To understand the use case more accurately, consider the Jamtara
example, where, after the frauds, large amounts of money are distributed in smaller chunks to obscure the trail. By
analyzing user behavior, transaction patterns, and device telemetry, it can detect anomalies such as unauthorized
access, phishing attempts, or deepfake attacks. This solution enhances security while ensuring a seamless user
experience for mobile banking and payment platforms, protecting users from sophisticated scams like those used in
Jamtara-style fraud schemes.
